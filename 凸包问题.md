# Extreme Point
point set $S=\{p_1,p_2,\cdots ,p_n\}\subset D^2$
A point $p$ of $S$ is called an *Extreme Point(EP)* iff there exists a line $L$ through $P$ such that *all$ point of $S$ lie on the *same side* of $L$
A polygon is *convex* iff every vertex is extreme
# To-Left Test
ToLeft(a,b,s) is TRUE iff s lies *left* to *directed line* ab
ToLeft(p,q,s) $\to Area2(p,q,s)>0 \to |p q s|>0$
# In-Triangle Test
InTriangle(p,q,r,s) if TRUE iff ToLeft(p,q,s),ToLeft(q,r,s),ToLeft(r,p,s) are all TRUE
We can use In-Triangle Test to solve the convex hull problem in $O(n^4)$
# Extreme Edges
All points in $S$ lie tot the *same side* of *Extreme Edges(EE)*
We can enum all the edges and check all the vertexs so that we can solve the convex hull problem in $O(n^3)$
# Decrease and Conquer
We can insert the points into a convex hull one after another. Time complixity is $O(n^2)$
## In-Convex-Polygon Test(ICPT)
In static case, we can use binary-search to solve the test in $O(n\log n)$
However, in this case the convex hull is dynamic, we have to use $O(n)$ time to do In-Convex-Polygon Test
## Tangents
If ICPT returns true, for a point *$x$* exterior to the hull, there are two tangent points $s$ and $t$.
To update the hull, we simply throw *$ts$* away and connect *$x$* with *$s$ and $t$*.
Given $x$, all *current EP's* can be classified into *4 types*——*L+L:s;R+R:t;R+L:st;L+R:ts*
# Jarvis March
The stategy is finding the next EP before attaching it to a *partial convex hull*. Time complixity is $O(n^2)$
All directed EE's form a CCW cycle. Each pair of consecutive EE's *share* an endpoint.
Let *$ik$* be an EE, then get next EE *$ks$* which has *minimum* left-turn.
We can use To-Left Test to make this step $O(n)$.
What's more, we can let the *lowest-then-leftmost(LTL)* point as the start point.
